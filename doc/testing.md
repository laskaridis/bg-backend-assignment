Testing
=======

The application includes two types of tests:

* `unit` tests
* `integration` tests, which extend the `IntegrationTest` base class.

> Note that _most times_ I start from writing the test _first_ first. I do this mainly to engage in an interface
> discovery process which is my opinion and experience, nearly always results in elegant and effective designs
> which are neither over- nor under- engineered. Because of lack of time, I didn't follow this process here and
> I think that this is evident is some circumstances. However, I hope that the existing code will give you an
> fairly good idea about my testing approach.
